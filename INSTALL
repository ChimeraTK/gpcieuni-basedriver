Main build targets:

$make (without arguments)
Compiles the kernel modules, but does not install it, nor does it install the
header files or the .symvers file. If you want to build dependent modules, you
either have to link or copy those manually (not recommended!!!) or install
this module. 

$make clean
Removes the files which have been created by make, except for
gpcieuni.symvers. This is a hack to enable dkms installation.

$make install
Installs the driver using the dkms mechanism. In addition the headers are
installed to

/usr/local/include/gpcieuni

and the symvers file is installed to 

/lib/modules/${kernelversion}/gpcieuni/Module.symvers

$make uninstall
Calls dkms remove and uninstalls the module, the headers and the symvers file.

$make debian_package
Creates a debian package from the corresponding tagged version in the
subversion repositoy. You need a working internet connection and a subversion
client for this (plus the debian tools to create packages). Only tested on
Ubuntu.
