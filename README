The driver uses a build system which automatically replaces the version number
in the module source code, the dkms config files and the debian packaging
files with the version number specified in the Makefile. This is the only
place where the version is stored, which makes maintenance easier.

To replace the version number, some files are created during the build process
from a version which has an additional .in extentension (gpcieuni_drv.c.in or
dkms.conf.in for instance). This is the file which is in version
control. Whenever you exit such a file, always edit the .in because the other
file will be replaced in the build process.

When building debian packages this is always done from the tagged version in
the subversion repository for the version number in the Makefile.
If you have not tagged the version, you cannot build a debian package. If you
have not increased the version number yet, but the trunk or the local copy
contains modifications with respect to the tag, the debian package will be
made from the tagged version in subversion and not contain these changes
(because they do not belong to this tag). This procedure is introduced to
prevent accidental creation of untagged versions.
